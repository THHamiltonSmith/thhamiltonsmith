## Hey there,

My name is Thomas. I am a full-time high school student from Adelaide, Australia, studying to get into university for a PHD in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Adelaide, or if I get the chance, maybe Stanford or MIT.

I have been coding since 2016 starting with HTML and CSS for basic web development, until moving on to Unity game development with C#, and other projects using C# and JS. I enjoy rowing and going to the gym, playing games and going out with the boys.

I started my own tech company called Sky Enterprises. I plan to make all kinds of technology, especially smart tech such as a virtual assistant, smart mirror and other software such as an operating system, project planner and more, If you want to take a look at my projects in detail, visit my <a href="https://www.skyenterprisesau.com">company's website.</a>

### What I'm working on

- I am currently working with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and C#, and am going to be learning Python, C, C++ and Assembly for future projects soon.
- I have been working on a bunch of projects on and off recently, but my two main projects are my <a href="https://skyenterprisesau.com/skyla">Skyla</a> assistant and a podcast app.
