## Hey there,

My name is Thomas. I am a full-time high school student from Adelaide, Australia, studying to get into university for a PHD in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Adelaide, or if I get the chance, maybe Stanford or MIT.

I have been coding since 2016 starting with HTML and CSS for basic web development, until moving on to Unity game development with C#, and other projects using C# and JS. I enjoy rowing and going to the gym, playing games and going out with my mates.

I started my own tech company called Sky Enterprises. I plan to make all kinds of technology, especially smart tech such as a virtual assistant, smart mirror as well as other software like an operating system, project planner and more. If you want to take a look at my projects in detail, visit my <a href="https://www.skyenterprisesau.com">company's website.</a>

### What I'm working on

- I am currently working with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and C#, and am going to be learning Python, C, C++ and Assembly for future projects soon.
- The main project I am working on at the moment is called <a href="https://www.skyenterprisesau.com/filmatic">Filmatic</a>, a movie streaming service for films made by independant filmmakers. I am also working on <a href="https://www.skyenterprisesau.com/filmatic">vCast</a>, a podcast hosting app and some other projects you can see on my website.
- I am also trying to start an open-source initivate called <a href="https://github.com/THHamiltonSmith/webdevhub">WebDevHub</a> which is a hub of tools for web developers. If you like, check out the GitHub page and think about contributing to help make the site even better!
- Theres more I'm working on that's coming soon, so stay tuned!
